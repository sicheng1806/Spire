# Ebou

This is a [ebou](https://github.com/terhechte/ebou) rewrite for learning
[dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com).

Ebou is a cross platform Mastodon (and Pleroma, untested) client written in Rust using the [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) UI library. It currently runs on macOS [`stable`], Windows [`beta`], and theoretically on Linux [`untested`].

Ebou is a different take on the Microblogging / Mastodon experience. It groups new Toots by author
and displays them in a UI not unlike modern messengers like Telegram, iMessage or WhatsApp.

This makes it easy to see your friends' updates at once.

It also has a **Conversation** view which helps seeing replies in the originating
context.

Ebou is currently an experiment and therefore missing some features which you might expect from a
full Mastodon client. They will be implemented over time.
